# Itheum Data Schemas

Welcome to our repository for Itheum Data Schemas used within the Spawnable ecosystem. Here, we've cataloged and documented the structured templates that govern how data is formatted and validated across Itheum's various systems and services.

## Overview

Data schemas are essential blueprints that ensure consistency, reliability, and clarity in our data-driven processes. As Itheum continues to grow and evolve, maintaining a standard set of data schemas ensures that different parts of our ecosystem can interoperate smoothly.

In this repository, you'll find:

- **Versioned Schemas**: As our systems evolve, so do our data requirements. We've incorporated versioning into our schema URLs to ensure backward compatibility and clarity.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Alongside each schema, there's a detailed breakdown of its components, its purpose, and any related information. This serves as a guide for both internal teams and external partners.
- **Links to Live Use Cases**: Where possible, we've provided references to live implementations or examples showcasing the schema in action.

## Usage

If you're integrating with Itheum's systems, consulting the relevant schema here will provide insight into the expected data format and structure. For developers and collaborators, these schemas act as a reference point for building and testing integrations.

## Contributions

Feedback and collaboration are at the heart of our open-source ethos. If you spot an inconsistency, have a suggestion, or wish to contribute in any other way, please raise an issue or submit a pull request.
